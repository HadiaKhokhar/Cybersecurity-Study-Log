DAY 1: LINUX BASICS
=========================================

1. SETUP & CONCEPTS
-------------------
* VirtualBox: Virtualization software to run different OSs inside your main one.
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS: A stable, beginner-friendly Linux distribution (Distro).
* File System Root (/): The top-level directory. Everything starts here.
* Home Directory (~): Your personal folder (/home/username).

2. CORE COMMANDS
----------------
* pwd       - Print Working Directory (Where am I?)
* ls        - List files and folders in current directory
* cd [path] - Change Directory (Move to a folder)
* mkdir     - Make Directory (Create a new folder)
* touch     - Create an empty file
* clear     - Clear the terminal screen

3. PRACTICE TASKS (PRACTICE THESE IN TERMINAL)
----------------------------------------------
* Create the path: mkdir -p Documents/BugBounty/Notes
* Move into it: cd Documents/BugBounty/Notes
* List contents: ls
* Go home: cd ~

4. INDEPENDENT RESEARCH
-----------------------
Q: Why do hackers use Linux?
A: 
- Open Source: You can modify anything to suit your needs.
- Tooling: Most security tools (Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit) are native to Linux.
- Automation: Powerful scripting (Bash/Python) makes repetitive tasks fast.
- Efficiency: It uses fewer resources than Windows and is highly stable.

Q: What is a terminal vs. shell?
A:
- Terminal: The "window" or GUI application that takes your input (e.g., GNOME Terminal).
- Shell: The "engine" that processes your commands (e.g., Bash or Zsh). 
  Think of the Terminal as the car's body and the Shell as the engine.
